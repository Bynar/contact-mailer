Hi <%= @lead.first_name %>,

My name is Michael and I represent Perspectivo - a cool new startup that's about to bring something different to the masses – access to other's experience.

At Perspectivo we aren’t looking for facts and data – that's easy to find today; we're targeting peoples' hard-earned experience which is highly valuable to those who face unfamiliar problems or new opportunities.

At this stage, Perspectivo is only open to a selected few, but down the line, it will be open to the world.  The advantage of being an early participant is that you will receive a head start in gaining recognition and targeted traffic as the site gains popularity. But equally important is the fact that you will help others who will put your experience to good use.

If you're interested, you can simply use your email address and log in to the system which is currently an invite-only site.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Cheers,

Michael

Hi <%= @lead.first_name %>,

My name is Michael Shawley. This is a no-nonsense invitation to view a new site called Perspectivo. The purpose of our site is simple: equip people across cultures and backgrounds to achieve their goals. Also, I should tell you that you are not on a list, we will only email you this one time.

When you enter the site, you will have the chance to share insights and wisdom you’ve gained in your life experience and also see what others have contributed so far.

We have worked hard creating a platform to make this possible. We want to share Perspectivo [dot] com with you and give you the opportunity to be an early adapter. The site is free to view and free to use.

If this has piqued your interest then please feel free to take the site for a spin. Or, if you’d like to know more before you try it, you can reply to this message and I’ll respond personally.

Kind Regards,

Michael

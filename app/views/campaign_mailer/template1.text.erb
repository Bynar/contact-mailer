Hi <%= @lead.first_name %>,

I’m Michael and I'm part of a small team launching Perspectivo.com, which is a site where you can post links to the best content on your site for free. Our site is for sharing your experience with others. You’re invited to our private beta:

http://www.perspectivo.com

We’re only just getting started. Login and you’ll be able to grab your favorite user id (we’re so new that your first name might be available still). You can be the first to add content in your areas of interest.

We think Perspectivo is going to be the future of how people share their experience with others. If that happens, it could become a big source of traffic for your site. We are a hub that points people to other sites.

Adding your perspectives to Perspectivo is as easy as posting a link. We are not a question/answer site -- we believe in a better way of sharing experience that is based on asking thoughtful questions instead of telling people what to do.

Please check us out. It'll literally take only a minute to visit the site and add a link to your own content -- or other content on the web that will help people reach their big life objectives or little daily challenges. If you want to check it out, just use the email address I’ve reached you with <%= @lead.email %> and take the site for a spin!

Cheers,

Mike

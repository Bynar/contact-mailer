  Hi <%= @lead.first_name %>,
  <br><br>
  My name is Michael and I’m part of a new startup called <a href="www.perspectivo.com">Perspectivo.com</a>. This is an invite to check out our private beta site. We have been searching for people with interesting content online and we decided to reach out to you. We’ll only email you this one time.
  <br><br>
  Perspectivo is a new kind of idea for the internet. We are gathering the perspectives of people all around the World.
  <br><br>
  We want to empower people to get their dreams and goals off the ground by giving them access to the experience of people who’ve “been there, done that." When you publish a perspective, you can add a link back to your site. If another user likes your input, they can follow up by clicking the link you provided. It’s a great way to share your experience, learn from someone else’s experience, and get traffic for your site.
  <br><br>
  We’re only just getting started. Login and you’ll be able to grab your favorite user id (we’re so new that your first name might be available still). You can be the first to add content in your areas of interest.
  <br><br>
  But the best way to explain it is for you to see it for yourself. Please, feel free to look around the site and share your experience with others. You’ll get a feel for how it works, and then you can use it as much as you want. I’m thrilled at the chance of getting you on board!
  <br><br>
  Cheers,
  <br><br>
  Michael

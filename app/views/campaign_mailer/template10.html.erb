  Hi <%= @lead.first_name %>,
  <br><br>
  My name is Michael Shawley. This is a no-nonsense invitation to view a new site called Perspectivo. The purpose of our site is simple: equip people across cultures and backgrounds to achieve their goals. Also, I should tell you that you are not on a list, we will only email you this one time.
  <br><br>
  When you enter the site, you will have the chance to share insights and wisdom you’ve gained in your life experience and also see what others have contributed so far.
  <br><br>
  We have worked hard creating a platform to make this possible. We want to share Perspectivo [dot] com with you and give you the opportunity to be an early adapter. The site is free to view and free to use.
  <br><br>
  If this has piqued your interest then please feel free to take the site for a spin. Or, if you’d like to know more before you try it, you can reply to this message and I’ll respond personally.
  <br><br>
  Kind Regards,
  <br><br>
  Michael

Hi <%= @lead.first_name %>,

I'm part of a small team launching a new website called Perspectivo. We want to create a place where users offer each other pointers in the form of questions to aid in unfamiliar situations. It’s a little different, but it’s cool…

There’s even a way for you to easily add links onto things others have posted. How about taking a minute to link your content into our site? If you like the setup you could even post a few pointers yourself.

I’d love to get you into our beta before we go live. To log in all you have to do is user your email address and create a username for yourself. You can take the site for a spin at perspectivo.com when you are prompted to enter your email address <%= @lead.email %> (be sure to input the one associated with this message)!

Kind Regards,

Michael
